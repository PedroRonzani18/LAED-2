## Introduction

In this project, we delve into the Traveling Salesman Problem, a classic optimization challenge. The problem entails finding the shortest possible route that visits a given set of cities exactly once and returns to the starting city. Two approaches will be explored: a brute-force algorithm and a heuristic.

## Project Objective

The project comprises two main components:

1. **Brute-Force Algorithm**: Implement a brute-force algorithm to solve instances of the Traveling Salesman Problem. This approach involves evaluating all possible routes to determine the optimal solution. While not efficient for larger instances, it serves as a baseline.

2. **Heuristic Application**: Apply a heuristic algorithm to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem for three instances. Heuristic algorithms aim to find reasonably good solutions in a shorter amount of time, making them useful for larger instances where brute-force is impractical.

## Traveling Salesman Problem

Given a set of cities where a path exists between each pair of cities with a positive distance, the objective of the Traveling Salesman Problem is to find a route that starts and ends in the same city, visiting all cities once, and covering the shortest possible distance.

## Implementation Details

- Develop a brute-force algorithm to systematically evaluate all possible routes and select the shortest one.
- Implement a heuristic algorithm (e.g., nearest neighbor, minimum spanning tree) to quickly generate good solutions.
- Design data structures to represent cities, distances, and routes.
- Apply the algorithms to instances of the Traveling Salesman Problem.
